GIT is unable to track an empty folder.
Without this empty folder, it causes an annoying popup dialog when SDK is closed at other PCs pulling the version of the SDK project.

The popup dialog shows that:
"
Problems occurred while trying to save the state of the workbench. 
Could not write metadata for '/RemoteSystemsTempFiles'. 
C:\ProjDevGIT\dna2firmware\Detector\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.core.resources\.projects\RemoteSystemsTempFiles\.markers
 (The system cannot find the path specified)
